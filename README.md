# Ultrafreezer-alarm
Arduino-based SMS alarm system for an ultrafreezer

The idea of this development is to be able to measure the temperature of a UF and the external temperature in the environment where it is located and to inform, through SMS text messages, about changes that are considered important in order to take the measures that are considered necessary. These changes could be:
•         Increase in UF temperature
•         Increased outdoor temperature
•         Cutting of the 220VAC line feeding the UF
•         Reconnecting the 220VAC line after an outage
•         Weekly/bi-weekly/monthly system status reminder to let you know everything is working normally
